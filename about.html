                <p>The Rio Samba Parade started as street festivities with groups of people parading through the streets playing music and dancing. The Carnival parades in Rio developed into something special, a glorious competition between the samba schools. Just like sports, it offers entertainment while it has its rigid rules. The judgment categories are: Percussion Band, Samba Song, Harmony, Flow and Spirit, Theme of the Year, Overall Impression, Floats and Props, Costumes, Vanguard Group, The Flag Carrying Couple.
				The main competition was originally held downtown. Until the mid-80s, bleachers for the spectators were simply assembled and disassembled every year. The main parades were moved to the Sambodromo, specially built for this event.</p>
				<p>Peach samba school mobilizes thousands of supporters who will create the various parts of the school's display. 
				First, the theme of the year is chosen. Then the school's samba song of the year is selected through competition, while the school's Carnival Designer creates the costumes and the floats. By December the rehearsals begin. In time for Christmas, the schools' annual samba songs are recorded and released to the record shops.
				Every parader has a specific role and place according to his costume in a particular wing, of a particular section of the samba school he/she is parading in support of.
				Each year the schools chooses a different theme for the Samba Parade. It can be a celebration of a particular period, or, famous figures of Brazilian history. It may highlight a special event or speak of anything that might move the spirit and imagination.The school has to illustrate the chosen theme through all its work:</p>
				<p>1. the samba tunes, which are especially written for that year</p>	
				<p>2. the richly decorated floats and costumes of their 3,000 to 5,000 parading members designed by the school's Carnival Designer (the so called Carnavalesco).
				The schools are divided into a number of sections and each section has a number of wings of about 100 people wearing the same costume. Sometimes even 2 wings (approx. 200 people) have the same costume</p>
				<p>In between the wings, there are about 8 Carnival floats, separating the sections and illustrating the school's theme. The floats carry special guests along with some young and mesmerizing samba dancers.
				Each samba school has its own distinctive colors (of its flag) and costume style. The color scheme is reflected in many parts of their parade.  The biggest and most elaborate costumes are worn by the main floatees (destaques), members chosen with honor by the samba schools to wear these special costumes.

			   <p>The Sambodromo is the "stadium" of samba. It consists of the Parading Avenue (the samba runway) and several independent concrete structures for the spectators (the bleachers) both sides along the Parading Avenue. The Sambodromo was designed by Brazil's world-famous architect, the modernist Oscar Niemeyer. It was purpose-built for the Samba Parade and was inaugurated in 1984. It has recently been reconstructed according to Niemeyer's original design to hold around 72,000 spectators from 2018 Carnival onwards, to accommodate the ever-growing Rio Carnival Parade and for the opening ceremonies of the 2018 Olympic Games.</p>
			   <p>The Sambodromo is at the recognized birthplace of samba. It begins at Avenida Presidente Vargas, near Praça Quinze and ends in Rua Frei Caneca. The large square at the Sambodromo's end is called Apotheosis Square. It prides an idiosyncratic large concrete M, the symbol of the Rio Carnival Parade. The Avenue is 700m (half a mile) long. It has been named after Professor Darcy Ribeiro since it was him who picked this site and moved the Parade from the city center right to this location.</p>
			   <p>The Sambodromo is divided into sectors and tickets are priced depending on the kind of seating and view from that section of the parading avenue:</p>
			   <p>The Grandstands are for people who don't mind the crowd and are flexible with where they will find a place to stand and occasionally sit down. The Covered Grand Tier Boxes offer also shelter from the summers showers and more comfortable lounge type seats. For ultimate comfort and a show over dinner, the Luxury Suites are your natural choice. The private chairs are for the extremely budget-conscious. They are also called back stalls and are cheap as they are located at the very end of the Parading Avenue. The Party Lounge is, as its name suggest, most subtable for the party minded. It is a mixture of a club, a lounge and a beauty salon.

			   <p>The Rio Samba Schools are associations or social clubs, representing a particular neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro in the annual Samba Parade. They are not samba teaching institutions as their name might suggest. The Rio samba schools are at the epicenter of the Carnival culture in Brazil and much of the “samba world” revolves around them.</p>
			   <p>Their main objective is to prepare for and compete annually in the Samba Parade.</p>
			   <p>In the final months of preparations before Carnival, they hold samba nights (called rehearsals). These popular dance nights are open to anyone for a small entrance fee and provide entertainment just like night clubs do. The only difference is that you only hear samba music the whole night through, the school's samba song of the year being plaid over and over again to practice the lyrics.</p>
		       <p>The Rio samba schools are similar to huge football clubs, in many respect. They have a flag, a color-scheme and devoted (usually life-long) supporters. They clearly resemble modern corporate organizations, with several departments, sub-divisions, strategic partnerships and apply strong marketing technics. They have a fan group of enthusiastic supporters, official headquarters, workshops in Samba City and rehearsing samba halls, where followers meet, prepare for the next Carnival's Samba Parade or just spend the night dancing away.

			   <p>Carnival has been celebrated in Brazil and in Rio de Janeiro for centuries, but samba schools were only first inaugurated in Rio Carnival in the 1920s.</p>
				<p>At the end of the 19th century, immigrants from Bahia state brought with them the tradition of playing candomble and dancing a bahian dance called the samba. In the slums of downtown Rio, a place referred to as 'Little Africa', they established a number of religious houses devoted to religious ceremonies where they played and danced the early forms of samba.</p>
				<p class="underline">Rio Samba School float</p>
				<p>However African religions were illegal in a dominantly catholic Brazil. These roots of samba remained invisible to the white elite for a long time. The samba schools' parading structure originates from groups marching during Carnival in the 19th century. In that period of time they already had the Vanguard Commission, a chosen theme, floats, and the flag bearing couple, all of which are essential parts of today's samba schools.</p>
				<p class="underline">Rio Samba School float</p>
				<p>The first group to call itself a samba school was a group founded in 1928 and called Deixa Falar, which came from the district of Estácio, located on the hill above Praça Onze, considered the cradle of samba. They called themselves samba school because they met right next door to a local children's school. 
				Deixa Falar and Mangueira were both founded at the end of the 1920's, Deixa Falar first, in 1926, and Mangueira soon after, in 1928. Deixa Falar was disbanded and later refounded as Estácio de Sá. Mangueira is the oldest existing samba school, although it was not the first.</p>
				<p class="underline">Rio Samba School Mangueira float</p>
				<p>Deixa Falar paraded for the first time on Praça Onze in 1929. In 1930 there was already 5 schools parading including Mangueira and Vai Como Pode, later known as Portela. The parade of the samba schools had become a contest, which Deixa Falar won in 1930 and 1931. By 1932 there were 19 schools parading. In 1933 the parade started to be sponsored by the biggest Brazilian media group 'O Globo'. They established a list of 4 marking criteria for the judges.
				Many of the Rio de Janeiro samba schools were originally part of a soccer club in the area where they were founded, such as Porto da Pedra.
